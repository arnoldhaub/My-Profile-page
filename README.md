# My profile page.

Cette page reprendra les informations basiques pour la r√©alisation du challenge : [My profile page](https://github.com/becodeorg/Swartz-6/tree/main/1.The-Field/5.Markdown-Final/My-profile-page-part-one-thinking-about-it)

## List of all the pages

- homepage
- about me
- my work
- my experience
- contact

### homepage

On this page I will briefly introduce my work, what I am doing.
I want visitors to know direcly who I am, what I am doing, what is my universe, how to contact me without going in too much information.

It has to be clear, attractive, simple but higly personalise.


### about me

This page will speak about me. I am going to share my story, who I am in detail, what are my goals, what is my background, what are my differences on the market, what I can bring, what I can do, how I work, my vision.

### my work

Visitors will see all the work I have already done in the past, with details and possibility to check it online.

### my experience

This page will display all my experience, all the compagny I have work with. I am still wondering if it is interresting to put in knowing that a page "my work" will already display my work... I have to think about what this page is going to offer

### contact

Simple page with a form inviting people to contact me. It will also show my phone number, adress, my social accounts, ... 

## wireframe

I am not going to make it right now. Surely a bit later because it will take too much time and I still have work to make beside that.

## how will my platform stand out from all the others

I do not know yet. I think by the design and the personalisation. For the moment I do not have enought skill to make animations like shown on the README, but I want to create a page that is like a mirror with my personnality.
